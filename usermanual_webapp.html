                <p>Licenses and groups are how we ensure the security of data within an organization. If you are an
                    organization with 300 locations, your users don't need nor want to see the activity of all 300
                    locations. To ensure the user only sees what they need to see, assigning licenses to groups cuts out
                    the noise by only showing the user what they need to see. One license can belong to 1 or multiple
                    groups.</p>
